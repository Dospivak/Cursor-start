# 🚀 Building Websites with Cursor's AI Helper

Hey there! Want to build a website but not sure where to start? Don't worry! This guide will help you create a website using Cursor - it's like having a smart coding buddy that helps you write code. Let's make it fun and easy!

## 👋 Before We Start

You'll need three tools on your computer:
1. [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) - Your smart coding helper
2. [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/) - For saving your website's information
3. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - For making your website look pretty

## 📥 Getting Your Project Ready

Just tell Cursor what you want to do! Here's how:

1. Open Cursor
2. Press `Cmd/Ctrl + K` (or click the chat button)
3. Say:
   ```
   Pull the repository from https://github.com/Dospivak/Cursor-start
   ```

That's it! Cursor will help you get everything set up.

## 🎯 Setting Things Up

### 1. Opening Your Project
Just ask Cursor:
```
Open the folder I just downloaded
```

### 2. Getting Ready to Code
Ask Cursor:
```
Help me set up everything I need to start coding
```

### 3. Setting Up Your Database
Tell Cursor:
```
Help me set up the database settings
```
When it shows you the settings file, just fill in your database information.

### 4. Starting Your Website
Ask Cursor:
```
Help me start the website
```

## 💡 Cool Things You Can Ask Cursor to Do

Instead of writing code yourself, try asking:
```
Create a new page called About Us with a nice layout
```

```
Add a contact form that sends emails
```

### Fixing Problems
When something's not working, just ask:
```
Why isn't this working?
